            Apple's iPhone 5c isn't the low-cost phone you've been waiting for

        <b>The iPhone 5c,</b> simply put, is for those who've grown numb to Apple's largely evolutionary
        takes on its primary iPhone range. It'll attract a younger audience that cares less about finely
        beveled edges and more about playing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-09-10-iphone-5s-and-5c-cases.html">Connect 4 on their iPhone case</a>. It'll cater to the same
        <font color="lightgreen"><i>crowd that has looked</i></font> longingly towards the $599 (again, off-contract) <b><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-08-05-motorola-moto-x-review.html">Moto X </a></b>-- a phone for the
        mainstream, and a phone that's as colorful as one's soul. In a way, this is the anti-Moto X. From a
        price, spec and feature perspective, it's a match that's too close to call. The iPhone 5c's camera
        <font color="red">has</font> an edge on the <font color="red"><b>Moto X</b></font>, but the X's Active Display is a boon for notifications. As these things
        tend to go, a lot of it boils down to ecosystem preference. The iPhone 5c is being built for the
        same audience as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-09-07-ipod-nano-review-2010.html">flashy iPod nano,</a> and moreover, Apple built it for those on Wall Street
        who feel that it simply must attract new markets to stay atop its game.


        <hr>

        Apple never showed intentions of racing the <font><b><u>Nexus 7</u></b></font> to the bottom in the tablet game, and the
        <font><b><i>iPhone 5c</i></b></font> is proof that it won't do that in the phone arena, either.
