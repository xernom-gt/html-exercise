      <b>Recently</b>, the high-end EV world has become a Nurburgring arms race with Porsche and Tesla
      vying for the best lap at the famed circuit. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-26-porsche-taycan-nurburgring-record.html">Taycan set a record</a> and <font color="red"><b>Tesla</b></font> <u>CEO</u> Elon Musk
      decided that the Model S would best it. From early reports, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-18-intrigue-at-the-nurburgring-as-tesla-unofficially-beats-porsche.html">Fremont company did just
      that</a> with a heavily modified vehicle.

    <p>
      Ahead of the Tesla run, I sat down with Porsche's North America <u>CEO</u>, Klaus Zellmer, to talk
      rivalries, where the <font color="grey"><b><i><u>Taycan</u></i></b></font> sits in the EV world and the surprising demographics it's gathered
      from its subscription service.

        "Many people are talking about competition   and all that. We love competition. We come from
        the racetrack. The Nurburgring; we love that environment. But first and foremost, we want to
        present an alternative, carrying the badge Porsche and the brand promise -- to everything that
        is electric out there right now." 
      </i> Zellmer said.

        Apple never showed intentions of racing the <b><u>Nexus 7</u></b> to the bottom in the tablet game, and the
        <b><i>iPhone 5c</i></b> is proof that it won't do that in the phone arena, either. <br>
